## "Internship Management System" - DBMS Mini Project (VTU - Vth semester)

The " Internship Management System" is developed and implemented using PHP MySQL database along HTML and CSS for the front-end. This project has been submitted as a part of my V semester DBMS Laboratory with Mini Project (18CSL58) of Bachelor of Engineering in Information Science & Engineering for the year 2021-22.

### :one: Introduction
Colleges are still using manual processes to manage internships. The manual process means the student must hand deliver or submit the internship certificate given by the company coordinator directly to the internship coordinators of his/her college. Additionally, college coordinators review a large number of these details and store them as proof for later reference. The traditional method of analyzing and maintaining internship data can be very time-consuming and labour-intensive. So, this "Internship Management System" provides a robust and easy-to-use mechanism for collecting, viewing, and managing internship information. It is a fundamental component of communication between the college, company and student, all at one place!

### :three: ER diagram
The ER Diagram for Internship Management System includes five entities, namely the College, Company Internship Coordinator, Student, Internship and Feedback. The College has an internship coordinator who can register the college, view the details of all the companies that provide internships and retrieve the internship details of any company, view the list of students who have completed at least one internship and retrieve the details of any student. The Company Internship Coordinator can register the company, set-up and update internships and give feedback to the interns who have completed the internship. Similarly, the students can register themselves after completing at least one internship. The registered student can update their profile and view the feedback.

### :five: Conclusion
it has become difficult to maintain the details of the internships. Thus this project is trying to bridges the gap between colleges, companies, and
students. Thank you!
